                    <p>We have stayed several times and the Beara Seaview B&B never disappoints. The view from the
                        property is unmatched, waking up and having a morning coffee outside while looking out at the
                        ocean is worth the say alone. The hosts are friendly, helpful, and ever so welcoming. The rooms
                        are of a high standard and location is within good distance of the local town. By Julia and Dave

                    <p>A B&B that we come back to time and time again. We rented all rooms for my 50th and it really was
                        a treat. The owners went out of their way to make my birthday weekend special. There are so many
                        wonderful aspects to this B&B like the ideal location, the breathtaking views, and the rooms
                        being very comfortable. Can’t recommend it highly enough. By Sarah and Simon from Dublin (Jan

                    <p>Even though it was a last-minute booking because our AirBnB rental got canceled, to our surprise,
                        we were over the moon with our stay at the Beara Seaview. The owners are so welcoming and went
                        out of their way to make our stay stress-free considering the panic we were in with nowhere to
                        stay 24 hours before our trip. We could easily stay all weekend at the B&B enjoying the views
                        morning, noon and night but it’s such a short walk to the local town where we enjoyed many a
                        pint with the locals. Looking forward to coming back again. The O’Driscoll Family from Waterford

                    <p>Had a fabulous time here with my partner and twin babies! The owners were lovely and really
                        accomodating to us! They did everything they could at breakfast to help us with our 9-month-old
                        babies so we could enjoy our food. The breakfast was a perfect and great way to start the day.
                        Also with fantastic views of the river! Cafes, takeaways, a lovely park and shops so close by!
                        We can’t wait to come back! Thank you so much for giving us such a great, personalised stay! By
